DATA SCIENCE IN HOSPITALITY BUSINESS : PREDICTING THE PRICE OF AIRBNB RENTAL

I want to write about implementation of Data Science and Statistics in Hospitality. I am interested to explore use case in AirBnB. AirBnB is an online service for booking lodging is trending around the world. During COVID-19, hospitality business is down but soon after this pandemic over The Business will continue to grow again. AirBnB need to prepare because the amount of people who are interested in staycation will rapidly increase.

Somehow, predicting the price of AirBnB rental will be very interesting. When we are able to predict the price we can answer this following question :

"How can we determine the optimal price so we can minimize overpriced and underpriced phenomenon ?"

Imagine if you already know the optimal price. We can recommend better pricing strategy for AirBnB. The final result we expect from the recommendation is increase in revenue.

Pricing is very important for business, 

1. If the price is too high the customer will think twice to book AirBnB rental. They may look for another hospitality provider. This is bad for the business because our customer will run into the competitor.

2. Lower price of course will attract more customer but if the price is too low it is also bad for business because AirBnB will suffer a loss.

So, what is the answer to this question ? The answer is Artificial Intelligent (AI). There is an called Regression. Using regression we can predict the price of Airbnb rental based on these following historical information :

1. Host that taking care of the rental

2. Available facilities

3. Location and Accessibility 

4. Availability

5. Testimony

Why should we use this AI ?

1. We can implement this AI in technology so we can get the price prediction automatically

2. This AI, Regression, doesn't need to be specifically programmed. We just need to expose the AI to the data.

3. This AI also can adapt easily. It just need to be exposed to new data.  

Success criteria of this method is depend on the accuracy of the prediction. We can measure how well the prediction result using R-Square. The value of R-Square is from 0 to 100%. The closer the value to 100 the better the prediction result. For this use case, the acceptable R-square value is at least 70%. So that is our target.
